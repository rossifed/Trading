# Quantaventis Trading Platform

## Introduction
Quantaventis is a modular monolith trading system designed for the end-to-end trading process of systematic funds, based on EOD (End-Of-Day) price data. It connects to Bloomberg EMSX to route orders and retrieve trade executions. Built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, it serves as a real-world example of a full trading stack, from booking to execution, risk, and more.

While Quantaventis can be run in production, it requires significant configuration (database, user rights, Azure, Bloomberg, etc.), so it is primarily intended as an educational and reference project. The motivation behind Quantaventis is to provide the kind of example that would have been invaluable to the author in the past, and may help others facing similar challenges.

Target audience: developers, traders, and fund managers seeking a comprehensive, real-world example of a systematic trading system.
